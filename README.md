# Simple Python Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python based Password Generator, which can generate a strong password for you to use on websites or wherever you want. There is no requirements.txt because it is created using the standard library of python, so you don't need to setup an environment.

This program saves all the passwords generated into a text file "passwords.txt", with the respective name of their websites. You can copy this file to save your passwords into multiple locations or consider to save on google drive or somewhere else.

You can also use a good password manager. But, that's a thing you consider on your own.
